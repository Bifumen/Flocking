This is an enemy AI flocking system built for Unity. Create an empty GameObject and make the enemies its children to group them. Add the Flocking script to the enemies and drag the empty GameObject to the “Group” field in the inspector. Use the “GetNormalizedFlockingVector” method to get the modified velocity or if you want to do it manually, use the “GetFlockingVector” method, add it to the GameObject’s velocity, normalize the velocity and multiply it with speed.
